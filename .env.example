# OpenAI API Key (optional, for AI features like image generation and code analysis)
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# The app works without this key - AI features will show placeholders instead
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Note: Copy this file to .env.local and add your actual API key if you want AI features.
# For demo/testing without API costs, leave it as 'your_api_key_here' or 'PLACEHOLDER_API_KEY'
